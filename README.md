- 👋 Hi, I’m @jbarth200
- 👀 I’m interested in python and how to automation everything we can to improve response time to anything, to help understand data and to help solve complex issues the most efficient way possible
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, git, bash, matplotlib, kivy, tkinter, restful API
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything to help me understand the development process, I have written small executable programs for work, looking to extend my knowledge. Would also love to help work modules to help make python easier!
